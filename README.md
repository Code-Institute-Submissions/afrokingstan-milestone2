# Holiday Spotter (second milestone project)

I have built a website that presents external users with a simple platform to spot potential holiday destinations and 
to find more information about their potential holiday and estimated flight cost. 
I displayed all information in a visually appealing and userfriendly manner.
 
## UX
 
User A- As a delivery driver based in USA, I am very familiar with google maps when i am looking for a place and directions.I will like to do the same or similar when I am search for my next holiday destination. 
User B- As a low income earner in the U.K, I always plan my holiday my self i want know more about holiday hotspots and the average cost of flight so that i can plan my holiday myself and estimate the true value of my money.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
This project is divided into 3 sections with different goals.
- Site owner's goal: to ensure that the site is easy to navigate, display information in a friendly manner and finally to possibly allow users to choose a travel package from third party website.
- External users goal : to find out best holiday destination for their needs. this is to be supported by reviews of pervious travellers to various holiday cities and their star ratings as well as google star ratings.
- Selecting relevant features/technology: to consider relevant features that will be meaningful for the external user and the right technology to create them.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- Feature 1 - Google API - allows all user to achieve a simplified google search which presents 5 key information about 3 main places to visit when on holiday in any city around the world.
- Feature 2 - TripAdvisor API - allows all users to view written reviews and rating by travellers and holiday goers about places vsited in the featurred holiday cities and allows users to leave their own reviews and ratings these place through a special redirect button. Finally through a special redirect button users can read more about these places.  
- Feature 3 - Skyscanner API - allows all users to find quotes for flights between specified cities and the ariline carrier.
- Features for the future - Festivo API or any API that can give users information about public holidays and specific festival details for various holiday destination.

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
